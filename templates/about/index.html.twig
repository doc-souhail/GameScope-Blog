    <p>
        Fan of gaming and more particularly of FPS, or First Person Shooter (like CS GO or
        Valorant) and story games (like the Assassin's Creed series), I decided to use this
        theme to create my exam project.<br>
        So I developed a web and mobile web application that allows each user to
        create an account and then share articles about the gaming world, such as the site
        ‚ÄúIGN‚Äù (‚ÄúGame Informer‚Äù).
        The user can also use a forum linked with GitHub in order to exchange with
        other enthusiasts and suggest if there are any changes to add to the site or alert on
        bugs to fix.
        This project is inspired by communication platforms like Twitter and Reddit or the
        Twitch streaming platform.
        Initially, GAME.SCOPE will offer the core publishing functionality
        of items. <br>
        The user can of course modify or delete his own publications.
        The administrator, meanwhile, will be able to act on both user accounts and their
        publications, in creation/reading/modification/deletion (or CRUD in English).
        v2 plans to develop a UGC (User Generated Content): each user post
        may be up voted or down voted. Clearly, an up vote will raise a publication in the
        ranking, a down vote will bring it down and lose it in the limbo of the site. Additionally, a
        comments system will be added
